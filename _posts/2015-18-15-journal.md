Ok, it's been far too long since I journaled. Time to get back into the groove again. So it has been a very interesting ride the last week or so. We have build a warehouse management system and put all of it's functionality online. 

We have begun our own personal projects as well. It's been super cool. 
The challenges countinue to mount. As soon as one thing is resolved, another challenge pops up. This week I'll be working on my personal project. So far, I have a decent looking website, and very little database functionality. Even though we've written tons of code, it's still pretty tricky to get the code to work on a new project. 

This is a fun and challenging field and I look forward to shwoing off my game to friends and family. We will see how it goes today. Be back soon!
