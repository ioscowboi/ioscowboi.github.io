So Monday, 2/9/15 is in the books. We are moving into web development. It's looking pretty fun so far. In a previous journal, I was frustrated about starting off with Ruby, but now that I've had some exposure to it and had a chance to get acquainted to OCS learning process, It makes total sense why we didn't go to html and css first. The web makes so much more sense now. 
Going through the process of trying to figure out how to get content to display on the command line was super handy. I can't imagine how much more bothersome it would have been to try to write code in Ruby and implement it on a website (which has its own bottlenecks). OCS has a very good thing going on for its students.
