So, the difference between gems and api's is tricky. It's more in the way they are used than anything. From the instructor's explanation, api's are used online to integrate with the website (to improve user experience). This could include a map, a weather forecast etc. Gems are used on the backend, inside of the program on the server to debug a program, test it, or add features to the program. Gems may interact with a website user, but it'll be more indirect than direct. Also, gems are usually a collaborative effort open to the public (open source), api's are a feature built by a company or someone who wants to retain control of the tool, but allowing a limited number of users to tap into it, while tracking them.
