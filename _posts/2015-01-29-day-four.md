Ok, so day four is in the books. Feeling a lot more comfortable with oop. Created the rock paper scissors program much more quickly than the previous program. 
Feeling like I can do this, but still have quite a bit of work to do. Still getting comfortable with pushing to github. I'll need to get a bit more practice before I'm in the swing of things for that. Overall, I feel like I will be quickly in a position to perform at an efficient pace (whatever that is). Ok, off to class! Day 5 underway!
