Wow, yesterday was a big day for me. Learned how to actually get my program to
integrate with the website. I had been doing it earlier this week, but it was more robotic at that point. Yesterday, I was owning it. I understood what was going on and why it was working. 
An interesting observation: I confirmed this week that I tend to go about things in an unorthodox way. I'll need to keep that in mind when working in pairs or teams with others. My approach may not be what an employer is expecting, or I may have to explain my process so that the employer or co-worker understands what I'm doing.
