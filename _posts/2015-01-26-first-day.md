Ok, so today was awesome. We learned about our classmates, the functionality behind git. We also learned about Classes and objects and methods. Wow, that's a lot for the first day. Overally, it was a powerful first day. Looking forward to day two, but I have some homework to do. 

I'm quickly learning that I'll need to get right up to speed to be successful. Ok, time to do the homework. Laters!
