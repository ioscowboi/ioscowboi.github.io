Ok, so today was awesome. We learned about our classmates, the functionality behind git. We also learned about Classes and objects and methods. Wow, that's a lot for the first day. Overally, it was a powerful first day. Looking forward to day two, but I have some homework to do. 


Alright, three things I learned today: 
1) How to inject variables into methods ex: 
def blah(param)
param + 2
end
var = 22
blah(var)
puts blah

2) Command for git and editing a doc. Commands include cd, mkdir, git init
3) How to create a class. Classes start with a capitalized letter. Ex: class One

Here's a question though from the Treehouse videos: how exactly do variables get stored in an array within a method? This is still throwing me off a little bit. 

I'm quickly learning that I'll need to get right up to speed to be successful. Ok, time to do the homework. Laters!
