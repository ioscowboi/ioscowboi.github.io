What was it like working remotely today? Did you miss seeing your classmates and instructors (If we may be so bold...) in person, and/or were interactions via Slack enjoyable in their own way? Was it hard to focus away from the school's space? Easier? How would you feel about working in a position where working remotely is the norm?

I actually would have preferred to be in class as far as productivity. I don't prefer to work from home because I can get distracted. If I had a choice, I would not want to work from home more than 30% of the time, although it depends on the work I need to do from home. It was very hard not to watch sports etc, and I'm sure I ate twice as much as I would have eaten at school. Slack was very handy. There is so much information on there, it can easily become information overload. If I did work from home, I would like to have a tool like Slack to stay on track, and submit updates throughout the day.
