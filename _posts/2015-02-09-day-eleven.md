Today's assignment was very interesting. I've had some experience with html and css, but I still picked up some new tools today. I can see why OCS had us start with Ruby. We needed this foundation before we could even understand how the website communicates with the server. Now that I have this understanding, it all makes so much sense. Watch my video for awesomeness!
