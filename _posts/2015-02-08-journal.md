So, we were given the assignment to do partner programming on Friday, the 6th of
February. It was a great learning experience. Omaha Code School really challenges us in unique ways. I mean, I had no idea it would be so challenging 
to communicate ideas and concepts to someone else in the class. 
As expected when developing a relationship with a new person, there was a huge
storming, and norming episode in the beginning. That took about two hours to get
through and then we were off and running. 
Overall, I learned that all relationships can produce amazing results, and that's exactly what happened with my partner. After the first day, we were both beat and hadn't got a ton of the work done. But the second day was very impressive.
We were able to complete 90% of the project by the end of the second meetup. We built almost all of the methods we would need for the rest of the project on day two. We also began to think about the command line interface. By day three, all the project requirements were complete. 
He was a great partner and I couldn't have completed all the work by the deadline without him. Lessons to take away: 
1) Never underestimate the power of teamwork
2) Avoid getting frustrated with forming relationships
3) Remember what got you here and use it to complete the required task
4) With a team, I can build anything!
5) Omaha Code School isn't just about learning how to code, it's about learning how to mold well with others. 

Omaha Code School rocks!
