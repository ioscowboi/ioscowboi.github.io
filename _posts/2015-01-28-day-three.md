Alright, so third day in the books. Finally got most of my dinner club program to work. It's not perfect, but I'm grasping the concepts more and more each day thanks to Summeet and Andrew. Those two are studs. Anyway, I'm not feeling discouraged at all. When I really dislike something, my head hurts. Here it is, 10:30pm, I've been at school since 9am and been coding all day, yet I feel like I could go for another hour if I needed to. Luckily I don't!

Ok, it's been a long day. Hopefully I sleep the whole night through and get up to speed tomorrow. This is fun.
